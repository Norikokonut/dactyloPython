This is a dactylotest like monkeytype but made in python.
It will use random words and give the time you made and your score at the end.
The text will change of color (it'll be green when it's done and the letter you have to type will be in yellow).

Just have to launch `main.py`.
Choose the language and the type mod by using your keyboard.

For the random words, this program scrap the words from a website 10 by 10.
This is totaly illegal if you use it for profit but if it's just for a personnal usage and you don't spam the server, it's totaly okay.
